# Egyptian-Party

This project has been an incredible opportunity for me to apply and refine my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, particularly focusing on JS animations and jQuery traversing. ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ‰
Highlights of my project:

- Interactive Navigation: Utilized jQuery for smooth sliding menu transitions.
  
- Accordion Sections: Implemented toggle functionality to show/hide details dynamically.
  
- Countdown Timer: Created a real-time countdown with JavaScript.
  
- Contact Form: Added a form with character count validation using jQuery.
